# Sparky's Logistics Website

## Overview

This is a React + Vite single-page web application for a trucking/delivery business. The purpose of this site is to:

* Allow customers to get dynamic delivery quotes based on distance and current market rate per mile.
* Present the business professionally to attract more load opportunities.
* Allow the owner to update market rates manually through a simple admin interface.

## Example customers and their experience

### Example 1: Freight Broker - "Jake from BlueLine Freight Solutions"

* **Profile**: Jake is a freight broker coordinating dozens of loads per day for clients across multiple states. He uses load boards and has a list of reliable carriers for quick fulfillment.
* **Needs**: Jake wants to confirm availability and competitive pricing for short-haul and regional box truck moves. He doesn‚Äôt need a lot of hand-holding, just efficiency and accurate info.
* **Experience**: Jake bookmarks the quote page and inputs new loads quickly by pasting in pickup/dropoff locations. The rate shows instantly, and he submits contact info and job reference. Sparky‚Äôs team responds quickly, and Jake adds them to his preferred carrier list for light freight.

### Example 2: Distribution Center Manager - "Mike from Midwest Wholesale"

* **Profile**: Mike runs shipping at a regional warehouse. He uses outside trucks when internal capacity is full or for last-mile deliveries within 300 miles.
* **Needs**: Fast quoting, clear load size restrictions (box truck only), and confirmation that the driver won‚Äôt be responsible for loading/unloading.
* **Experience**: Mike uses the site on desktop. He inputs a shipment from his dock to a retail location. After seeing the quote, he sends it to his dispatch team and fills out a short form requesting service with a note: "No driver assist. Liftgate required."

### Example 3: Event Logistics Planner - "Tina with TopTier Exhibits"

* **Profile**: Tina coordinates booth setup for trade shows. Her job is to get event materials and displays from her company‚Äôs warehouse to venues on strict delivery windows.
* **Needs**: A clean experience with estimated delivery times, optional email confirmations, and confidence that freight won‚Äôt be mishandled.
* **Experience**: Tina uses the quote form a week in advance, sees the rate, and submits a request for a delivery from their regional staging warehouse to the convention center. She adds a comment that the venue requires a specific arrival location and time.

### Example 4: Independent Furniture Retailer - "Jorge from Carolina Rustic Living"

* **Profile**: Jorge owns a small showroom selling rustic and reclaimed furniture. He occasionally needs to ship a few large pieces to customers across state lines.
* **Needs**: A dependable carrier for irregular long-distance deliveries. Wants clarity on what handling is included and a mobile-friendly interface.
* **Experience**: Jorge visits the site on his phone, enters his store as the origin, and a customer‚Äôs house as the destination. The quote displays clearly, and he‚Äôs prompted to confirm whether the customer will help unload. Jorge submits the form and gets a follow-up call that afternoon.

## Features

### 1. Dynamic Pricing Tool

* Customer inputs pickup and dropoff locations.

* System calculates route mileage using Google Maps API.

* Cost is calculated using a manually updated market rate per mile.

* Right now on 123LoadBoard Jeff views these tools to determine where he wants to bid so that he can come in a little bit under the daily load rate.  He can enter this manually here but it would be better to derive this data to the site eventually.

  * marketRate is a tool that provides the average market rate to help compare lane rates before posting loads and better     estimate your load revenues
  * Cargo Chief shows market rate estimates baed on the highest, middle and lowest rtes gathered from actual freight bills rather than quoted prices

- greenscreens is a tool that shows both quotes and verified load

### 2. Google Maps Integration

* Location autocomplete fields
